TREEHOUSE iOS TRACK

In interface builder you can right click on view items and have a comprehensive list of actions or outlet options 
More specific way to tell the view controller what we want to do 

ex. : 
  touch, shake, etc events
  referencing outlet 


Look at the docks : cmd-shift-0
Look up specific item in text editor (function etc) -> option-click shows you the doc content about that specific item

Architecture: 
  View - Controller - Model (MVC)
    view and model do not communicate
    controller makes the connection

Layout: AUTO LAYOUT 
  constraints || elements || or both
  use ctrl-click-drag line to edge and the select constraint you want
  autolayout options are on bottome right corner

+ sign denotes a class method - called on actual class not on instance

Project -> Info Tab -> add a thing  -->go to appDelegate.swift

DEBUGGING: 
Breakpoints --> left side of editor in the gutter 

ICONS: 
  design square icons - let xcode round them

Launch Screen : .storyboard to design it

Fun Ideas from here: 
  slot machine with emojis
  coin flip app  

Double: up to 15  --> apple tells you to use this one 
Float: at most 6 

Binary : 
  true == 1
  false == 0
