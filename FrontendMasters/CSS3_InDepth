Content-editable —> property in html that lets user change content - won’t save on refresh but actually works in style tag to change styles on the page for ex


:nth-child(an+b) :: a = incremented, n = variable(always n), b = offset
	ex: :nth-child(3n) —> every 3rd child 
	    vs. :nth-child(3) —> just the 3rd element

ex: :nth-child(3n+17) —> start at 17th element and from there are on every 3rd element

key words: even, odd ::ex::    :nth-child(even) :nth-child(odd)


Look in to ‘target’

‘::’ (double colon) is peudo element not class

HTML5 boilerplate -> read it

library: selectivizer.com shows support

you dont need jQuery if only selecting 1 or 2 elements use : document.querySelectorAll(selector)


!important --> use for debugging elements tyling

GENERATED CONTENT: 
	not part of the DOM - can't highlight or manipulate with JS but can style 

	p:before {
		content: "before content -";
		font-weight: bold;
	}
	p:after {
		content: '- after content';
		font-weight: bold;
	}
